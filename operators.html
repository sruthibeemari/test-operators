    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Operators</h3>
    <b>Question 19:</b>
    <p>Write a program that uses arithmetic operators to calculate the result of a * b + c, where a = 5, b = 10, and c = 20. Then, compare the result to 100 using comparison operators.</p>
    <b>Question 20:</b>
    <p>Given two variables, x = 8 and y = 12, use logical operators to check if both x is greater than 5 and y is less than 20. Print the result.    </p>
    <b>Question 21:</b>
    <p>Create two numbers, num1 = 25 and num2 = 35. Use the ternary operator to check which number is larger and return the appropriate message.</p>
    <b>Question 22:    </b>
    <p>Define two variables, m = 15 and n = 10. Perform subtraction and division operations, and then check whether the result is an even or odd number using a comparison operator.</p>
    <b>Question 23:</b>
    <p>Write a program that declares age = 18 and checks whether the age is equal to or greater than 18 using both the equality (==) and strict equality (===) comparison operators.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Objects</h3>
    <b>Question 1:</b>
<p>Create an object representing a car with properties make, model, and year. Use Object.freeze() to prevent modifications, then try to change the model and display the result.</p>
<b>Question 2:</b>
<p>Create an object representing a user with properties name, age, and email. Use Object.isFrozen() to check if the object is frozen and display the result.</p>
<b>Question 3:</b>
<p>Create an object representing a product with properties name, category, and price. Use Object.isSealed() to check if the object is sealed and display the result.</p>
<b>Question 4:</b>
<p>Create an object representing a laptop with properties brand, model, and price. Use Object.keys() to list all the keys in the object and display them.</p>
<b>Question 5:</b>
<p>Create an object representing a house with properties location, size, and price. Use Object.values() to retrieve all values from the object and display them.</p>
<b>Question 6:</b>
<p>Create an object representing a smartphone with properties brand, model, and price. Seal the object using Object.seal(), modify the price, and then check if the object is sealed using Object.isSealed().</p>
<b>Question 7:</b>
<p>Create an object representing a book with properties title, author, and publishedYear. Freeze the object using Object.freeze(), then try to modify the publishedYear and check if the object is frozen using Object.isFrozen().</p>
<b>Question 8:</b>
<p>Create an object representing a person with properties firstName, lastName, and age. Use both Object.keys() and Object.values() to retrieve and display all keys and values of the object.</p>
<b>Question 9:</b>
<p>Create an object representing a course with properties title, instructor, and duration. Use Object.entries() to get the key-value pairs, and then modify the object using the delete operator to remove the duration property.</p>
<b>Question 10:</b>
<p>Create an object representing an employee with properties name, position, and salary. Seal the object using Object.seal(), modify the position, and then use Object.keys() to list all properties and verify that no new properties can be added.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">String</h3>
<b>Question:1</b>
    <p>Write a program where you need to extract the middle part of the string and converted it to upperacse</p>
    <b>Question:2</b>
    <p>Write a program that converts a string to uppercase and then calculates the length of the resulting string.</p>
    <b>Question:3</b>
    <p>Write a program that retrieves the character at a specific position in a string, and then finds the ASCII value (character code) of that character.</p>
    <b>Question:4</b>
    <p>Write a program that removes extra spaces from the start and end of a string, and then slices a portion of the string starting from the second character to the fourth character.</p>
    <b>Question:5</b>
    <p>Write a program that concatenates two strings where the first string is in its original case and the second string is converted to lowercase before concatenation.</p>
    <b>Question:6</b>
    <p>Write a program that removes leading spaces from a string, and then slices the string starting from the second character to the end.</p>
    <b>Question:7</b>
    <p>Write a program that retrieves a specific character from a string and converts it to uppercase.</p>
    <b>Question:8</b>
    <p>Write a program that removes trailing spaces from a string and then concatenates it with another string.</p>
    <b>Question:9</b>
    <p><pre>Write a program that:
        Trims extra spaces from the start and end of a string.
        Converts the trimmed string to uppercase.
        Extracts a substring from the second character to the fifth character from the uppercase string. 
        Example Input:
        javascript
        Copy code
        let string1 = "HELLO";
        let string2 = "WORLD";
        </pre>
        </p>

    <p>Question: 10
        Write a program that:
        <pre>Converts two strings to lowercase.
        Concatenates the two lowercase strings with a space in between.
        Retrieves the first character of the concatenated result.</pre>
        </p>
        <pre>
            Example Input:
javascript
Copy code
let string1 = "HELLO";
let string2 = "WORLD";

        </pre>
